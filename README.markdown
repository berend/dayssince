This is a small test case to track a szenario like "It's been x days since last fire alarm". Inspired by quite a few fire alarms in our office building. Inspired by this:

##Following Issues:
* Days are not always calculated correctly
* GQL queries can be more elegant
* DB structure/queries are not optimized

##Planned features:

* add record high
* add record low

# Big changes

* Add multiuser support, create your own alarms with custom text etc
* use some kind of auth of the secret page
